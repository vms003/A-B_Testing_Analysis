# A/B Testing Case Study

## üìã Overview
This project analyzes the effectiveness of marketing campaigns using A/B testing methodology. The primary focus is to evaluate whether the campaign succeeded and quantify the impact of advertisements on conversions.

### Objectives:
- **Determine Campaign Success:** Evaluate the overall performance of the marketing campaign.
- **Quantify Ad Impact:** Understand how much success can be attributed to advertisements.
- **Provide Actionable Insights:** Derive meaningful conclusions for business decisions.

### Data Fields:
| Field Name      | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Index`         | Row index.                                                                |
| `user id`       | Unique identifier for each user.                                           |
| `test group`    | Group assignment (`ad` for experimental group, `psa` for control group).   |
| `converted`     | Conversion status (1 = Purchased, 0 = Not Purchased).                      |
| `total ads`     | Number of ads seen by the user.                                            |
| `most ads day`  | Day of the week when the user saw the most ads.                            |
| `most ads hour` | Hour of the day when the user saw the most ads.                            |

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Converted `converted` to binary format.
- Categorized `most ads day` for easier analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Conversion Rates:** Analyzed and visualized conversion rates by test groups.
- **Ad Effectiveness:** Explored the distribution of ads and their influence on conversions.

### 3. Hypothesis Testing
- **Chi-Square Test:** Tested statistical significance of conversion rate differences.
- **T-Test:** Compared total ads between groups.

### 4. Segmentation Analysis
- **Day-Based Insights:** Analyzed conversion rates by the day of the week.
- **Hour-Based Insights:** Explored conversion rates by the hour of the day.

### 5. Predictive Modeling
- **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier.
- **Goal:** Predict likelihood of user conversion based on ads data.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Classification report and ROC AUC score.

### 6. Interaction Effects
- Explored interaction between `total ads` and `most ads hour` using logistic regression.

### 7. Incrementality Testing
- **Incremental Lift:** Measured the added benefit of ads over the control group.

## üîç Key Insights

1. **Conversion Rates:** Experimental group (`ad`) achieved higher conversion rates compared to the control group (`psa`).
2. **Ad Impact:** Incremental lift highlights the direct contribution of ads to conversions.
3. **Optimal Segments:** Certain days and hours drive significantly higher conversions, offering targeting opportunities.
4. **Predictive Power:** Random Forest model provides reliable predictions for user conversions.
5. **Interaction Effects:** Ads shown at specific times have a higher likelihood of driving conversions.
